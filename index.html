      <p>Hi, My name is Ryan Russell and thank you for visiting my Profile. Here I hope to give you a since of myself. First, through this introduction I would like to explain to you who I am and tell you a bit about my life. Second, I would like to show you some of the work I have done that would show my skills and abilities with several developer languages and tools and Finally I would like to provide you with my contact information as well as a way for you to be able to reach out to me.</p><br>
      <p>So if you have made it this far, you have probably learned the sound that gets my attention and that is my name. I am horrible at talking about myself, but as you are well into the second paragraph, here goes! To start with I am happily married (usually) and have been that way for 9+ years. My wife and I (her name is Shelley) have no children, we have a puppy named Magnus. We call her Maggie when we arenâ€™t trying to be formal. Currently I am working in Educational Technology Management and she occupies her time with accounting. When I am not working or engaged in development, I like to both play and listen to music. I have played for several years and have picked up and attempted to play most any instrument. I have actually been successful at playing one or two. With some of my other spare time, I like to travel and play with technology.</p><br>
      <p> While I have taken most of the last paragraph to explain my time outside of work. I will this paragraph to explain my time in work and what I am looking for to grow my career. Since graduating college I have been involved with helpdesk or end user support in some way or another. I have worked on a few different help desks working with general consumer grade products to managing helpdesk in which I supported more specialized and industry specific products. I have always excelled in a help desk role due to my strong communication skills and my abilities to translate technical issues to non technical users in an effort to convey problems and messages.</p> <br>
